				<p class="graf lighter">I am a Utah native and a computer geek at heart. Ever since I was a kid, I was fascinated with computers and technology and have wanted to incorporate that passion into my career.</p>
				<p class="graf lighter">Video games are what really got me into computers. From Earthworm Jim on the Sega Genesis to World of Warcraft to Rock Band, games have been an integral part of my life. Nowadays I use games as a social network, playing online with friends who live hundreds of miles away from me and being able to keep in contact with them.</p>
				<p class="graf lighter">Besides video games I also LOVE music. I listen to dozens of albums a month and have a huge variety and somewhat eclectic taste. I am becoming more and more of a music critic and have even started writing my own music reviews for my own personal amusement. I hope I can hone my critic skills into something entertaining as well as informative for people who are looking for new music to get into.</p>
				<p class="graf lighter">That's pretty much me, or at least enough to fit on a small web page. It is still early in my life and I am super excited for what the future may hold.</p>
